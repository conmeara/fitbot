# Program Building Guide (Evidence-Based)

Use this file when creating or revising a training plan.

## 1) Build Around Adherence First

- The best program is the one the user can complete consistently.
- Fit frequency, session length, equipment, and environment before optimizing details.
- Always include fallback sessions for low-time, low-energy, or limited-equipment days.

## 2) Start Mesocycles With Clear Targets

Define, per mesocycle:

- Primary goal (strength, hypertrophy, fat loss support, skill, conditioning)
- Key performance markers
- Constraints and pain flags

Practical default:

- Mesocycle length: 4-8 weeks, then review and adjust.
- Keep skill practice frequent and low-dose (for example 5-15 minutes most days).

## 3) Set Weekly Volume and Frequency

Practical defaults for trained-but-not-elite users:

- Begin around 8-12 hard sets per muscle group per week.
- Progress toward 12-20 sets per week only if recovery and adherence remain good.
- Use frequency to distribute volume and improve quality (for example 2-4 sessions/week per muscle pattern).

Evidence note:

- Weekly set volume is a primary hypertrophy driver.
- When weekly volume is equated, higher frequency is often not independently superior.

## 4) Load, Reps, and Intensity

- Use heavier work for maximal strength development.
- Use moderate-to-high rep ranges for most hypertrophy/accessory work.
- Hypertrophy can occur across a wide rep range if sets are sufficiently challenging.

Practical split:

- Main strength work: lower-to-moderate rep ranges.
- Accessory/hypertrophy work: moderate-to-higher rep ranges.

## 5) Progression and Autoregulation

- Progress by reps, then load, then set volume.
- Typical load increments are small and conservative.
- Use RPE/RIR or simple readiness checks to adjust day-to-day load and volume.

If recovery drops:

- Reduce volume first.
- Keep technical quality and movement patterns.
- Use a short bridge week or deload before resuming progression.

## 6) Deload and Fatigue Management

- Plan deloads roughly every 4-6 weeks for many users, or sooner when recovery markers degrade.
- Deload by reducing volume and proximity to failure while preserving movement patterns.

## 7) Pain-Aware Programming Rules

- Pain changes the plan immediately.
- Substitute by movement pattern (push/pull/squat/hinge/core), not random exercise swaps.
- Track pain flags in `FITNESS.md` Active Adjustments and review each week.

## 8) Review Cadence

- Daily: log session completion and pain/recovery notes in `fitness/history/`.
- Weekly: summarize trends in `fitness/weekly/`.
- End of mesocycle: evaluate outcomes and set next block targets.

## Practical Research Workflow

1. Start with position stands and meta-analyses.
2. Check whether evidence applies to the user population (beginner/intermediate/advanced, age, injury status).
3. Translate findings into simple, executable rules in `FITNESS.md`.
4. Reassess every mesocycle using actual user adherence and recovery data.

When using community-sourced routines, validate with evidence-based principles and adapt to user constraints instead of copying directly.
