## Daily Non-Negotiables (Optional)

- Skill practice block (5-15 min):
- Mobility/recovery block (5-15 min):

These should be short enough to complete even on busy days.

## Session Template

1. Warm-up (5-10 min)
2. Skill or power work (optional)
3. Main strength blocks
4. Accessories/conditioning
5. Cool-down and mobility

## Progression Rules

- Choose one primary progression model per block:
  - Rep progression
  - Load progression
  - Density progression
  - Assistance regression/progression (for bodyweight skills)
- Progress only when form and recovery are acceptable.

## Deload Rules

- Planned deload every 4-6 weeks, or sooner if recovery markers worsen.
- Typical deload:
  - 30-50% less set volume
  - Lower proximity to failure
  - Maintain movement patterns

## Substitution Rules

- If pain appears, substitute movement pattern, not just load.
- Preserve intent:
  - Squat pattern
  - Hinge pattern
  - Push pattern
  - Pull pattern
  - Core pattern

## Constraint Fallback Rules

- Define one fallback session for:
  - Minimal equipment day
  - Low-time day (20-30 min)
  - Low-energy day
- Fallbacks should preserve training intent and maintain consistency.

## Review Cadence

- Daily: session feedback in history logs.
- Weekly: recap and plan adjustments.
- Monthly: bigger block-level changes if needed.
