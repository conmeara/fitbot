# Adaptation Playbook

Use this when real life disrupts ideal training.

## Priority Order

1. Protect joints and calm pain flare-ups.
2. Keep consistency alive.
3. Progress only when recovery supports it.

## Constrained-Day Decisions

### Time-crunched day

- Keep warm-up brief (3-5 min).
- Run only the primary movement block.
- Keep one key accessory or skill set.
- Log as a successful reduced session, not a miss.

### Low-energy day

- Reduce volume by 20-40%.
- Stay farther from failure.
- Keep movement quality high.

### Equipment unavailable

- Swap to same movement pattern:
  - Pull, push, squat/lunge, hinge, core
- Keep session structure simple and executable.

### Missed session

- Do not stack punishment volume.
- Resume plan with a bridge session, then return to normal progression.

## Pain Flag Handling

When a pain flag appears:

1. Record it in today’s `fitness/history/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
2. Add/update an entry in `FITNESS.md` Active Adjustments:
   - Date
   - Flag
   - Impact on training
   - Review date
3. Modify session immediately:
   - Reduce load and/or range of motion
   - Replace aggravating movement
   - Keep training intent where possible
4. Re-check the flag in the next 1-3 sessions.

When symptoms resolve, remove or close the adjustment entry.

## Skill Practice Rule

For long-horizon skills (for example handstand), use short high-frequency practice (5-15 min) and avoid exhausting max attempts in every session.
