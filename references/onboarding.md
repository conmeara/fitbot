## Step 1: Confirm Setup

1. Confirm `FITNESS.md` exists in workspace root.

- Primary goal (fat loss, strength, skill, conditioning, hybrid)
- Secondary goals
- Training age/experience
- Available days and session length
- Equipment access
- Injury history and current pain flags
- Preferred training style and disliked movements
- Preferred coaching tone (for example direct/no-cheerleading vs more motivational)
- Recovery constraints (sleep, stress, work schedule)
- Environment constraints (for example weather-dependent training, travel, limited space)

## Step 3: Build Baseline Plan

1. Read `references/program-building.md`.
2. Use `references/program-template.md`.

## Step 4: Start Tracking

4. Add at least one fallback training option for constrained days.

## Step 5: Weekly Loop

At week end:
